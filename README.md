# A Written Report for the PyBer Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis
The objective of PyBer_Challange is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride sharing data by city type amongst rural, suburban, and urban locations. The summary contains information for, total Rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. Eventually this data can be integrated with data showing how each city type increases or decreases over time and then plotted onto a multiple line graph. 

### Resources
**Source of Data** : city_data.csv, PyBer_ride_data.csv, ride_data.csv

**Software** : Python 3.7.6 , Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code.
