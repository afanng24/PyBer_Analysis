# A Written Report for the PyBer Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis
The objective of PyBer_Challange is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride sharing data by city type amongst rural, suburban, and urban locations. The summary contains information for, total Rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. Eventually this data can be integrated with data showing how each city type increases or decreases over time and then plotted onto a multiple line graph. 

### Resources
**Source of Data** : city_data.csv, PyBer_ride_data.csv, ride_data.csv

**Software** : Python 3.7.6 , Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code.

## Results
### Summary DataFrame

From the PyBer summary we can see that the majority of rides are in the urban area followed by suburban and then rural areas. There are many more drivers and total rides in the urban area than there are in any other and because of that total fares are also the most there. Because there are so many drivers the average fare per driver and average fare per rider is also less than the other two city types. In summary the majority of PyBer ride sharing is in the urban area. 


Taking the data over a period of four months from 01/01/2019 to 04/28/2019 we can plot out the difference overtime between the three city types and their popularity on a multiple line graph.

## Summary

From the summary DataFrame we can ascertain that the majority of PyBer ride sharing is currently in urban areas, that is after all were the most total fares come from. However, there are more drivers than total rides in the urban area leading to less average fare per driver as well as less average fare per ride. There is huge growth potential as there is more demand for drivers than there are total rides in both rural and suburban areas with an emphasis on the suburban area especially as there are only 490 total drivers with 625 total rides. If some urban drivers can be convinced to also give out rides in the suburban area then the average fare per driver would increase in that area but still be much better than the average fare per driver in the urban area. The same goes for the rural area however, this is the place with the least amount of rides and the most average fare per driver. The same strategy can be utilized here with having more drivers in the rural area however due to lack of demand it is unclear whether more drivers would be beneficial. 

From the multiple line graph we can see that the end of February is where the majority of rides are being carried out with the fare in $USD being the most across the three city types. Drivers could be shifted to the suburban area at the last weeks of April as urban rides decrease and suburban rides increase.
